"As an openly gay man who grew up in Missouri, I found life to be much easier hiding my sexuality. If I am asked, I will tell. But frankly, it’s no one’s business but my own. And here is a recent example of why microaggressions lead me to continue to hide who I am.To “throw shade” is to belittle someone inadvertently through looks, comments, gestures…Recently at work, I decided to share with a coworker that I am gay. During conversation she made me feel comfortable enough with her to allow her into that part of my life. Although her reaction was with pause (having no idea, she claimed), it was as if our work relationship never changed. Honestly, we’re closer now than ever before, which is great. I started to think that with the passage of marriage equality for the LGBT community, there was a different mindset held by the people of this nation. That we LGBT are equal under the law, and that people recognize that.Tolerance, however, is a different story.Within weeks of telling the first coworker that I was gay, it started to come up in conversation. Other people asked, and I wondered how it seemed that everyone had been talking about it.Now a month has gone by, and the relationships with my coworkers have changed. The other day, a coworker told me in front of other coworkers that he doesn’t agree with gay marriage. That it’s an abomination. That we should have our own “thing”. That marriage by definition is for a man and a woman, so why should gays be able to marry? It doesn’t make sense to him. “Nothing against you,” he says. That, right there, belittles me as a human being. It’s difficult to work at a place where I am told that I am inferior, but what choice do I have? To walk away and let the bullies continue to win? To contact HR with a case of someone throwing shade?There are certain coworkers who look at me with disgust when no one is around, as if I’ve committed the most heinous act. Every time I’m walking the floor and pass these certain coworkers, I continue to smile and go on about my way as I see them give me a look that only “throwing shade” can describe. I feel as if they are so upset with who I am that I am not even welcome anymore. As if I have offended them by working there and I should not have applied for that job in the first place. I understand that we need to have thicker skin to deal with our problems and that we should hold our head high because we know who we are. But subtly making someone feel inferior is an act of bullying. I am not making myself a victim, the aggressor is. I can understand why the tipping point of racial injustice is turning sideways because the feelings of these “victims” (as some would like to put it) are no longer feeling hurt, they are starting to feel upset and angry. All we are doing is trying to stand up for ourselves against a bully. Doing so in one-on-one settings isn’t helpful or appropriate. It only further allows the bully to know that they have control over our feelings, and we are tired. Taking this to a national stage and letting the world know they exist is the only way to stop the repeated acts of harassment.Although some argue that teaching about this type of bias will lead to a culture of victims, we are already victims. We have lived with a lifetime of being victimized, and it is nice to finally stand up and call out our aggressors. These aggressors were once called bullies, and people once laughed along with them. Now it seems the people who are upset because we are “victimizing ourselves” are the ones who are continuing to bully us today. I thank you for giving us the ability to speak up and not feel ashamed. These slight aggressions make it more difficult to work and at times even to be in public.

That American spirit includes staying true to the unity and diversity that makes us strong — like no other nation in the world. In this age of instant reporting and tweets and blogs, there’s a temptation to latch on to any bit of information, sometimes to jump to conclusions. But when a tragedy like this happens, with public safety at risk and the stakes so high, it’s important that we do this right. That’s why we have investigations. That’s why we relentlessly gather the facts. That’s why we have courts. And that’s why we take care not to rush to judgment — not about the motivations of these individuals; certainly not about entire groups of people.
The thing is: people actually had jumped to conclusions, fueling both suspicion and violence across the country. Multiple social networks and communities on the internet began to conduct their own searches for suspects in photographs. Most of these “suspects” turned out to be brown people with bags. Some people were identified solely by color or by supposed nationality. Some people were identified by name, and their names spread publicly and quickly, without hesitation. Worst of all, real people were attacked. Subtle and open aggression powerfully shaped lives this week.
We know that the creation of unsafe conditions for people of color, immigrants, Muslims – among others – does not appear out of thin air, informed by rationality or reality. They are a product of power and fear. Every geopolitical event of this sort has put whole communities on edge, anxious about the backlash against them. And while hate crimes get documented, the more subtle interactions of fear and hostility can slip through.
All week, from the coming Monday to Friday, we hope to publish submissions of incidents related to the recent attacks experienced by South Asians, Muslims, immigrants, and people of color. For this, we are asking for your help.
If you have experienced an incident of this type, please submit your story to submissions@microaggressions.com. There are no limits on length or format. (Please put “week” into the subject of your email; they’ll be forwarded directly to editors, who will put them up as soon as they can.)
If you have not experienced an incident of this type, we ask that you share this with people you know. Use Twitter, Facebook, and any other social networks to spread the word!

"Andrea Smith plenary talk at Critical Ethnic Studies and the Future of Genocide, Thursday, March 10, 2011 (via zombifuntime)(via zombifuntime-deactivated2012072)",['meta'],"“
What settler colonialism does is that it sets a ceiling on what the future can be such that we cannot even imagine a future without genocide. This tendency then leaves us to develop critical visions only within the constraints of the possible and then infects all the work that we do.
For instance if we look at the Academic Industrial Complex.  We whine and complain about how racist it is.  As if the only problem is a few racist administrators who need to be fired. And if we just convince them how great Ethnic Studies is, they’d just give us more money.  But if we were actually to imagine a liberatory educational system would this be it? Professors, do we say, “Tenure was the most fun thing I’ve ever done, I wish I could do it again”?  Do students say, “You know, I love it when I work really hard for my finals and then get a bad grade anyway, how empowering was that”?  We don’t even try to imagine building an alternative to the Academic Industrial Complex.  We act as if the problem is that there is racism in the academy, not that the academy is structured by racism. And here’s where we can learn from the Prison Industrial Complex.  Is not that the organizing against the Prison Industrial Complex puts forth a model of abolition that doesn’t just say that it’s about tearing down prison walls now but it’s about building alternatives that squeeze out the current system. Similarly, while we might have day jobs in the academic system, why can’t we start building alternatives to this system, build the educational system that we would actually like to see that could then squeeze out the current system as it develops. So, for instance, when Arizona says something like they’re going to ban Ethnic Studies, we think, “Oh no, there’s not going to be Ethnic Studies because the State says so!” We presume the state owns Ethnic Studies and it actually can ban it.  We don’t say, “Uh, whatever, Arizona! Ethnic Studies is not a gift from the Academic Industrial Complex or from the state.  It’s a product of social movements for social justice, and as long as they exist there will be Ethnic Studies wherever and whenever we go.” And did we ever really think Ethnic Studies was going to be legitimate in a white supremacist and settler colonialist academy? And if ever did become legitimate, we would know we had failed in our task.",

But then I think that it would also end up on microaggressions for actively pursuing someone because of their skin colour. I believe then that it gets labeled as “fetishizing” that person…This seems like a no-win situation. It seems to me like a person, especially a white person, is not supposed to have a preference for skin colour. I don’t agree with this.

This is a great and really thoughtful question. While we are not any “authority” about microaggressions, for our blog and from what we’ve read, it would not be posted as a microaggression. The idea is that microaggressions are extremely frustrating, violating little walls that people face in their everyday lives due to one or multiple identities they have.  The original idea for the project was to document this visually so that when for example person of color is explaining to a white person who does not share the “oppressed” identity, they could show this website and see a whole conglomeration of these commonplace, daily slights they have to face. While you clearly are conscious and recognize the Islamophobic microaggression, the project is about providing a voice for people who have to experience it. That being said, often times our submissions do not include all of the context or clarify the identity of the submitter, so we don’t know - but we’ll usually give it the benefit of the doubt & post it if it resonates with us. lastly, I would love for this to be a wider discussion for the microaggressions community - this is a question we get very often.

"I work on commission in a male-dominated electronics store, and I know exactly what I’m talking about. However, I will always get customers that either ask to talk to a man, or “Someone who knows more about X.” I will also get male customers that either hit on me, flirt with me, call me pet names like ‘sweetie’, 'honey’, 'darling’, or 'sweetheart’, or touch me. What makes it worse is that although I am allowed to refuse to deal with them and pass them on to another coworker, we have to hit a target for sales every day so I generally just grin and bear it. It’s humiliating.","['xs', 'gender', 'sexism', 'macro']","I work on commission in a male-dominated electronics store, and I know exactly what I’m talking about.

"aeraspais:To be honest, I dislike how often discussions of racism get derailed to explain to people that the dictionary definition is out-of-date and inadequate but I feel it is a conversation we need to have.  Racism will always be more complex than a “hatred or intolerance of another race or other races”.  It is a set of practices and subconscious behaviors that continuously teaches us to default to white, where “nude” is considered to be beige, and black folks and Hispanics have higher incarceration rates than whites for the similar crimes.  By saying this I am not undermining bullying you may have received in grade, middle or high school and I am also not saying people of color cannot be prejudiced against other races themselves.  All I am saying is we, as people of color, cannot be racist since we lack the power to full on oppress you.  It is truly that simple to grasp.(via zombifuntime-deactivated2012072)","['meta', 'race']",,

"Dealing with microaggression is a bit like standing in a hail storm. Though each individual pellet of ice may sting, no single one on its own can do real damage. But together, they can punch through car wind shields and strip the bark off trees.Each microaggression impacts the self-worth of an oppressed person, makes them feel invisible, makes them feel uncared for, makes them feel hopeless that anything will ever change. Over time, it all adds up.To help illustrate the way microaggressions work, I offer you this dramatized “day in the life” of a young urban trans guy—specifically, me. All of the incidents described herein have actually happened, though not all in the same day. I have compressed time somewhat in order to quickly give you a sense of the impact that microaggressions can have, when in reality these incidents may have occurred over many months. Think of it as being like a time-lapse video—it shows a process exactly as it occurs, except for its being very accelerated.(via tranarchism)","['gender', 'meta', 'trans']",A Day In The Life Of An Angry Transsexual,

So start talking to one another. We will moderate, and depending on the frequency of trolling, we may change some settings. But for now, it looks like you’re all really nice people.

"According to a user,","['meta', 'xs', 'faq']","According to a user,
I think your layout header thing is blocking the follow button. i had to do a lot of maneuvering to follow you!
… and another,
Hi, I had the same problem trying to find the follow button. It is there on Chrome, but the ‘inspire well’ theme bar sets itself overtop it; I think there’s something up with the coding. I was able to see it in the html on Chrome, but I couldn’t find a way to click it… I had to use internet explorer to do it. For some reason, when I open your page in IE, the theme bar moves to the bottom and then the follow button is easily viewable.
… and last but not least:
The follow button has a tendency to disappear on a lot of people’s pages. You can still use it, it just won’t be visible. If you hover your mouse over the upper right hand corner of the page, you can still click on it so long as your mouse icon indicates you can (and your browser doesn’t tell you the link leads to your dash, of course). It’s what I had to do and yeah it works. Hopefully it’ll be fixed soon (like anything on tumblr?).
Hope this helps! We’re looking to get a domain sometime in the near future and get it right, but until then we hope this issue doesn’t keep you from sharing this site with your folks this holiday season.",
